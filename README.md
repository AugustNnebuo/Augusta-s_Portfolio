# 	[Project 1: Exoloratory Data Analysis Project](https://github.com/AugustNnebuo/EDA-on-Google-Playstore-Dataset-)

This is an exploratory data analysis project i did on the Google Playstore dataset. The goal of the prject was to help google which product/app are mostly patronised by their customers, why, and how they can increase their sales. It was a personal project.

* Data was gotten from Kaggle
* The project was done with Python on a Jupyter notebook. Pandas and Numpy was used for the analysis, and seaborn and matplotlibb for visualization.


# 	[Project 2: House Pricing Prediction Model](https://github.com/AugustNnebuo/Price_Prediction_Model)

This is a machine learning regression model. The goal of this project is to be able to create machine learning model that can predict the prices of future houses in a district in California based on the data from previous sold houses. 

*The data used was the California Housing Dataset from Kaggle.
*Algorithms used: Pandas,Matplotlib, Seaborn, Linear regression model, lasso regression model.


# 	[Project 3: Heart Failure Prediction](https://github.com/AugustNnebuo/Heart-Failure-Prediction-model)

This was a group project done for the WomenTechsters Fellowship Program.  A classification model was built to detect if a patient has or does not have a heart disease 
based on the other features known. 

Algorthms used: Logistic regression, Decision tree, Random forest, SVM, KNN
